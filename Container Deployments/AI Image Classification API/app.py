"""
This python file uses the Flask framework to serve an image classification AI model
as a REST API. The model is loaded and executed using Keras and TensorFlow.

Usage:
Start the server:
   python app.py
Submit a request via cURL:
   curl -X POST -F image=@dog.jpg 'http://localhost:5000/predict'
