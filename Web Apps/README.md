# Web Applications

This repo contains web applications I've created using various technologies.

* College Sports Rant - This web application uses the standard MVC model. React is used for the front-end development and utilizes react router for page management and redux for state management. The Nodejs backend contains the controller for serving the REST APIâ€™s, JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication and the data model definition for a cloud hosted MongoDB database. The live link to the operational site is: http://collegesportsrant.com/  And yes, I know the content probably needs updating!

* Nodejs REST Backend - This is a Nodejs, Express, MongoDB backend that serves RESTful API's. The MongoDB database is hosted on an Atlas cluster in the cloud. Refer to the README file in its folder for specific details on accessing the API's.

* Spring REST - This is a REST backend developed using the Java Spring framework and connected to a locally hosted MySQL database. Hence, you will need to create and start your own local MySQL DB for this backend application to work.

* Tech News - This is a blogging web application developed using AngularJS. It is hosted in the Heroku cloud and connects to an externally hosted MongoDB database.  Live link: https://techno-news.herokuapp.com/

* Watches - This is a cool watch sales website developed using HTML5, CSS3 and fair amount of JavaScript. The shopping cart functionality was developed using JavaScript and includes a React slider at the top of the page.  The product catalog is stored in a local MongoDB database.  The web application uses a Nodejs web server and is also hosted in the Heroku cloud. A little bit of additional tweaking is required to optimize the site for mobile platforms.

* Flask with MongoDB - This is a simple and crude "To Do" list application developed using Python, Flask and PyMongo to connect to a local MongoDB database.  Developed primarily to gain a better understanding of using PyMongo. Be sure to start the MongoDB database instance before starting the Python/Flask web application.

* React Clock - A couple versions of a react clock component I created.
